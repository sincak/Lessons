<h1>NEWTON'S LAWS OF MOTION</h1>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
Long ago people believed what they observed. They saw that objects that were set into motion eventually stopped moving even if nothing seemed to be stopping them, so people concluded that it must be an inherent property of all mass that it just eventually stops moving on its own. And if they couldn't observe it in everyday life, they took a guess and went with it. It sure seems like heavier things should fall much faster than light things, so they just concluded that that was the way it is. But we shall soon see that both of these so-called 'theories' are very very <b>*WRONG*</b>!
<h2>Isaac Newton</h2>

Isaac Newton was a scientist and mathematician from England who lived in the 17th century. Along with Albert Einstein (who came much later) he is considered one of the greatest scientists the world has ever known. Newton's contributions to almost every branch of science including mathematics is astounding. Many consider him to be the world's first true first physicist.
<p>
Isaac Newton was superb at both types of science - experimental science where observation and recording these observations meticoulsy is key, and theoretical science - which is making sense of these observations and putting them in a theoretical framework that other scientists could then test and verify. Along with his Theory of Gravitation, Newton's Laws of Motion are the most important scientific advance the world had ever seen for more than 300 years. And amazangly there are only three!
<p>
<h2>Newton's First Law of Motion</h2>
<p>
Newton's First Law of Motion says this:
<p>
An object travelling at a constant velocity will maintain that velocity unless a force acts upon it.
<p>
That's it! No equations, no math, one sentence. Wow! And to us it seems obvious - when we watch space capsules coasting through space we are very familiar with this. But remember in the 17th Century, there were no capsules coasting effortlessly through space, and certianly no televisions to watch them with. So what was the experience of someone in the 1600's? Well if they would push something on level ground it would of course eventually stop, so they figured that stopping was inherent to the object itself. But Newton saw that it was actually stopping because an external force was opposing the motion. It was not obvious to people then but we now call this force friction (in aircraft we call it drag).
<p>
The fact that Newton said constant velocity means the Law is also true for objects at rest. If we think about it we realize that an object at rest certainly has constant velocity - a velocity of 0. Because of this people sometimes quote the Law as: "An object at rest tends to stay at rest until an external force acts upon it." This is still Newton's First Law of Motion.

<h2>Newton's Second Law of Motion</h2>
<p>
As we saw, the First Law is one simple sentence. It doesn't even involve any math. It is what we call qualtative - it tells what happens but doesn't really put any numbers or measurements on it. The Second Law is quatntiative - we can use it as a formula and put real values in it. Best of all it is only one simple equation!
<p>
Force = Mass times Acceleration, or F = m â‹… a
<p>
The way that Newton wrote it was: The amount of force to accelerate an object to a certain velocity is directly proportional to its mass.
<p>
This is considered one of the most important formulas in all of physics and it simply means this: The more mass an object has the more force we must use to speed it up or slow it down a given amount. This certainly makes sense - if we want to slow down a train going 30 miles an hour to a full stop it will certainly take more force than completely stopping a tricyle going 30 miles an hour. Importantly, it tells us the force is directly proportional to the mass - so something with 10 times more mass should take 10 times more force to slow it down or speed it up any specific amount. It will help to get a handle on this by using the formula with specific examples, which we will practice in the next section.

<h2>Newton's Third Law of Motion</h2>
<p>
Newton's Third Law is a simple qualtative statement such as the First. You may have heard it before - it is the most quoted of Newton's Law:
<p>
Every action results in an equal and opposite reaction.
<p>
Like the other two laws it is simple, concise, and extremely useful. It means that if I push you and you don't move, it will feel the same to me as if you were pushing me. That's pretty much it! It seems simple, but we see how useful it is when we consider some examples that might seem counter-intuitive. For example, as strange as it seems, the force the Earth is exerting on you through gravity is equal and opposite to the force you are exerting on the Earth - that's right, you and the Earth are acting on each other with the exact same gravitational force! But most people ask "How can that be? The Earth is humongous in comparison to me!" Well, that is where we can bring in the Second Law. Even though the force is exactly the same, the acceleartion that you are causing to change the Earth's velocity is minsicule compared to the acceleration the Earth is causing you. And this of course is because of your much smaller mass compared to the Earth's mass.

Thanks to space filght many of these laws are easier to see for astroanuts in capsules or on the International Space Station. Why do astronauts always look like they are moving so slowly? Because they <b>ARE</b> moving slowly! And it's not because they are encased in some kind of fluid - they are in a near vaccuum - there's not even much air! So what's going on? They move slowly because they know any force they exert will cause an equal and opposite reaction on them and since they are in low gravity or even weightless, this will cause an acceleration that would be very inconvenient if they were to slam into expensive space equipement! For example if an astronaut uses a wrench to turn a bolt he must remember that the bolt exerts the same force on him that he exerts on the bolt, and that he will by the Second Law therefore accelerate somewhat, something he probably doesn't want to do while working on a piece of equipment.
<p>
Below is a link to a demonstration of the Third Law by an astronaut on the International Space Station. He demonstrates with a basketball and a fellow astronaut 57 seconds into the video.

<h2>Using the Laws to clear up common misconceptions</h2>
<p>
Newton's Laws are so simple and powerful we can use them in our every day modern life. In fact many people still have wrong ideas about basic motion and these are seen every day in TV and movies. Let's look at some fun examples.
<p>
How many times have we seen a superhero movie where Superman or Spiderman saves someone from hitting the ground by snatching them up at the last minute? The real question is were they actually saved by not hitting the ground - and the answer is NO WAY! It is not the hardness of the ground that can cause serious problems, it's the huge acceleration. Remember, acceleration is change of velocity within a certian time - if the time is short the change and therefore acceleration is very large. And by the Second Law, if the acceleration is large the associated force must be very large too. So thanks but no thanks Spidey, I'll use a parachute next time!

Another common misconception is that rockets push against the launchpad to go up. This is easily seen to be false by watching a soldier with a hand held rocket launcher send a missle into the air with no launchpad behind him, or an interplanetary probe that is shot on its way while still in Earth orbit. So what is happening? It is the Third Law - the force of the gas superhot super high-speed gas exhaust is equal and opposite to the force of the rocket being propelled. And how fast does the rocket go? We can then use the Second Law to calulcate the accleration/change of velocity of the rocket over time.

<p>
All three Laws have their place and in most problems in physics we will use all of them together. Now, let's practice on some real world examples.
